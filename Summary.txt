Problems done on Arrays :
1. Rotation of arrays; left and right
	- Brute force - O(n) & O(n)
	- Optimal - O(n) & O(1)
		- using array reversal

2. Remove Duplicates;
	- Brute force - O(n) & O(n) in worst case
	- Optimal - O(n) & O(1)
		- using two pointer approach
		
3. Finding the kth smallest and largest element in array;
	- Brute force - sort, remove Duplicates, then print till new size you got from duplicates. O(NlogN) + O(n) & O(1)
	- Priority Queue

4. Checking if array is sorted;
	- it can be rotated and sorted too.
	- think of first and last elements as well.

5. Sort an array with 0s, 1s and 2s in single scan.
	- sorting
	- count 0s, 1s and 2s - fill the array
	- 3 pointers - most efficient algo. Dutch National Flag Algo. It's like sorting colors.
		- Think of 0...low-1, low....mid-1, mid...high, high+1...n

6. Moving all zeros to end.
	- Sorting
	- Two pointers
	- Always think of low, mid, high and think that how mid should change and where swapping will get changed.
